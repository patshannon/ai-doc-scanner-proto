🧩 Problem

Most mobile document scanner apps make capturing documents easy — but organizing them afterward is tedious and error-prone.

After scanning, users still need to:

Manually name each file

Decide where to store it (category/folder)

Upload or move it to the correct Google Drive folder

For users who regularly scan receipts, forms, or contracts, this process quickly becomes repetitive and frustrating. Important documents often end up misplaced, uncategorized, or hard to find later.

💡 Solution

The AI Document Scanner streamlines the entire process from capture to cloud storage.

After snapping a photo of a document, the app uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and AI-based classification to automatically:

Extract text and detect document type (e.g., invoice, receipt, ID, tax form)

Generate a smart title (e.g., “Invoice – Acme Corp – Oct 2025”)

Categorize the document under the appropriate folder (e.g., Finance → Invoices)

Check Google Drive for existing folders matching the category and use them when possible

Upload the document with consistent naming and metadata

This turns a multi-step manual process into a one-tap workflow — users simply scan and confirm, and the system handles everything else automatically.
